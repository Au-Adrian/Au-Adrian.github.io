# Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)

*The problem:* Despite the various number classes available in UH campuses, students still have a hard time searching for their perfect class because they have to take into account numerous variables such as time schedule, availability, and requirement fulfillments. Star may have expedited the process of choosing your own class, but it doesn’t tell you the quality of the class and the teacher.

*The solution:* 
Similar to rate my professor, if students are unsure of whether or not they would be interested in another class we will have this website where students who have already taken the class can give first hand input on what the class was like, if they would recommend, tips and tricks etc. 

# Approach
Because this is a rating app for UHM classes, users will be anonymous. 

# Mockup page ideas
- Landing Page
- Admin Page
-Different pages that go to different topics about the class

# Use case ideas
- Anonymous user goes to class page, rates them

# Beyond the basics
- Graphs (user grade for that class vs their rating for that class)
