summary: A taro growing simulator I developed for ICS 111
---

This simulation was my first project that I created in Introduction to Computer Science I at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This program gives the user a feel for what it is like to be a farmer. When you start the program, the taro starts off in a healthy stage, as time goes on, you must evenly distribute water and soil to the taro to keep it healthy and to get it to reach the fully grown stage. If you distributed too much water, the taro would become unhealthy and the program would end. Vice versa in regards to soil. Once the taro reached a certain stage, the program would end by saying "You win!"
